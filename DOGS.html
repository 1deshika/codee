  <h3>Brief explanation of Space</h3>
     <p>Space can be defined as the very area in which all existing entities are confined whether that be our very solar system to the countless objects and entities that our mind cannot comprehend. With educated guesses we can say that our universe came forth to exist from a singularity and now expands faster with each second that passes to the point where now not even light can catch up. We maybe stuck within this endless confine but there are many interesting objects that makes up our universe ranging from galaxies to black holes big enough to span our solar system and nebulas. For now the universe is said to be 13.8 billion years old.</p>

  <p>The universe is filled with mysteries and incomprehensivable entities that we have yet to discover but for now lets go over the history of the universe.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>1.The Primordial Era</dt>
    <dd>The Primordial Era is defined as "âˆ’50 < n < 5". In this era, the Big Bang, the subsequent inflation, and Big Bang nucleosynthesis are thought to have taken place. Toward the end of this age, the recombination of electrons with nuclei made the universe transparent for the first time.</dd>

      <dt>2.The Stelliferous Era</dt>
      <dd>The Stelliferous Era, is defined as, "6 < n < 14". This is the current era, in which matter is arranged in the form of stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters, and most energy is produced in stars. Stars will be the most dominant objects of the universe in this era. Massive stars use up their fuel very rapidly, in as little as a few million years. Eventually, the only luminous stars remaining will be white dwarf stars. By the end of this era, bright stars as we know them will be gone, their nuclear fuel exhausted, and only white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes will remain. In this section, Olbers' paradox is discussed.</dd>

      <dt>3.The Degenerate Era</dt>
      <dd>The Black Hole Era is defined as "40 < n < 100". In this era, according to the book, organized matter will remain only in the form of black holes. Black holes themselves slowly "evaporate" away the matter contained in them, by the quantum mechanical process of Hawking radiation. By the end of this era, only extremely low-energy photons, electrons, positrons, and neutrinos will remain.</dd>

      <dt>4.The Black Hole Era</dt>
      <dd>The Black Hole Era is defined as "40 < n < 100". In this era, according to the book, organized matter will remain only in the form of black holes. Black holes themselves slowly "evaporate" away the matter contained in them, by the quantum mechanical process of Hawking radiation. By the end of this era, only extremely low-energy photons, electrons, positrons, and neutrinos will remain.</dd>

      <dt>5.The Dark Era</dt>
      <dd>The Dark Era is defined as "n > 101". By this era, with only very diffuse matter remaining, activity in the universe will have tailed off dramatically, with very low energy levels and very large time scales. Electrons and positrons drifting through space will encounter one another and occasionally form positronium atoms. These structures are unstable, however, and their constituent particles must eventually annihilate. Other low-level annihilation events will also take place, albeit very slowly. Essentially, the universe will eventually turn into a void.<dd>

        <p>The above data is just a short description of the possible timeline of our universe which was made using educated guesses.To furthermore understand the history of our universe till the present here is another list to provide detailed information required:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lets start with a bang</dt>
          <dd>The Big Bang was not an explosion in space, as the theory's name might suggest. Instead, it was the appearance of space everywhere in the universe, researchers have said. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe was born as a very hot, very dense, single point in space Cosmologists are unsure what happened before this moment, but with sophisticated space missions, ground-based telescopes and complicated calculations, scientists have been working to paint a clearer picture of the early universe and its formation.A key part of this comes from observations of the cosmic microwave background, which contains the afterglow of light and radiation left over from the Big Bang. This relic of the Big Bang pervades the universe and is visible to microwave detectors, which allows scientists to piece together clues of the early universe.</dd>

          <dt>The first growth spurt</dt>
          <dd>When the universe was literally just created something like a hundredth of a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second.it underwent an incredible growth spurt. During this burst of expansion, which is known as inflation, the universe grew exponentially and doubled in size at least 90 times.</dd>

          <dt>Too hot to shine</dt>
          <dd>For the first 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the intense heat from the universe's creation made it essentially too hot for light to shine. Atoms crashed together with enough force to break up into a dense, opaque plasma of protons, neutrons and electrons that scattered light like fog.</dd>

          <dt>Let there be light</dt>
          <dd>About 380,000 years after the Big Bang, matter cooled enough for electrons to combine with nuclei to form neutral atoms. This phase is known as "recombination," and the absorption of free electrons caused the universe to become transparent. The light that was unleashed at this time is detectable today in the form of radiation from the cosmic microwave background.
</dd>

<dt>Escaping the cosmic dark age</dt>
<dd>
Roughly 400 million years after the Big Bang, the universe began to come out of its dark ages. This period in the universe's evolution is called the age of re-ionization.This dynamic phase was thought to have lasted more than a half-billion years, but based on new observations, scientists think re-ionization may have occurred more rapidly than previously thought.During this time, clumps of gas collapsed enough to form the very first stars and galaxies. The emitted ultraviolet light from these energetic events cleared out and destroyed most of the surrounding neutral hydrogen gas. The process of re-ionization, plus the clearing of foggy hydrogen gas, caused the universe to become transparent to ultraviolet light for the first time.</dd>

<dt>Need more stars and galaxies</dt>

<dd>Astronomers comb the universe looking for the most far-flung and oldest galaxies to help them understand the properties of the early universe. Similarly, by studying the cosmic microwave background, astronomers can work backwards to piece together the events that came before.Data from older missions like WMAP and the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), which launched in 1989, and missions still in operation, like the Hubble Space Telescope, which launched in 1990, all help scientists try to solve the most enduring mysteries and answer the most debated questions in cosmology.</dd>

<dt>The birth of our solar system</dt>

<dd>Our solar system is estimated to have been born a little after 9 billion years after the Big Bang, making it about 4.6 billion years old. According to current estimates, the sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy alone, and orbits roughly 25,000 light-years from the galactic core.</dd>
<p>This sums up the entire history of our universe but we still need to know more for the universe is vast and mysterious hence why we need to push forward for the development and progress of aquiring the deepest secrets and knowlegde of our universe.</p>
